#Which Animal will you slay
EVTDESCarmenian_apostolic.1;Matagh is a time-honored tradition, just as Abraham sacrificed the ram on Mount Moriah to give thanks to the Lord now I will do the same. It is a gift to God through giving alms to the poor by distributing the meat of the donated animal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBarmenian_apostolic.1;I will go with a rooster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Decide who leads the Sacrifice #1
#armenian_apostolic.2;By your own hand or not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCarmenian_apostolic.2;Traditionally the Matagh is carried out the organizer but many find the thought of killing an animal with their own hands unappealing. One can either participate in the sacrifice personally who push the burden onto a servant. Though not everyone is able to partake the Matagh even if they are willing, women are barred from participating in the slaughter of the animal. While technically not considered a Matagh, women are able to participate in a similar celebration with doves but there is no killing of animals. Since matagh is an offering to God, a crippled and sick animal cannot be sacrificed, since it is customary to offer gifts to God, both material and spiritual, pure, immaculate, selected and best, from honest earnings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Successful Matagh
EVTDESCarmenian_apostolic.7;Matagh is a giving of alms, in the Gospels of Luke it is said, "When you hold a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors, in case they may invite you back and you have repayment. Rather, when you hold a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAarmenian_apostolic.7;God is good and God is great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
