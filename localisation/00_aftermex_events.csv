EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_2;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will go see the most sacred city in the continent.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_21;Ciudad de México;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_21;You have arrived to the center of Mexico. You stand now in El Zócalo and in front of you is La Catedral Metropolitana, you enter it and immediately feel in another world. The beautiful crooked majestuosity of it all, it takes you aback, you almost crash with the flags and remains of the First Emperor.\nYou thought nothing would make your heart race more after that, but then you finally arrived to the great Explanada de Guadalupe just in front of the ancient Basilicas. You see thousands and thousands of pilgrims on their knees, they are doing penance so that Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe intercedes for them. Never before had you seen such a beautiful display of faith. You can feel the presence of Dios within all those people, and withing yourself as well.\nYou see the Basilica on the other side of the square, La Tilma de Juan Diego, La Virgen de Guadalupe, awaits you patiently inside. But you must not make her wait for you are only her humble child and she is the Empress of the Americas. Tears roll down your face.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_21;I kneel, and on my knees I begin to walk towards the temple of my faith.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_3;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will make the hike to meet Cristo Rey.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_31;Cristo de la Montaña;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_31;You finally made your way to El Cerro del Cubilete, located not far from either Silao or León, and home to El Santuario de Cristo Rey. While the stone-paved road in the slopes of the mountain may be steep, the occasional glimpse of what awaits you at the top fills your body with stamina to push forwards.\nThe sanctuary is not the first monument of Cristo Rey to be erected in El Cerro del Cubilete, there used to be another one but a tyrannical ruler of Old Mexico destroyed it using dreadful weapons of the Old World. But Cristo Rey and the faith will never be broken and so the current monument stands were the previous one stood.\nYou have finally made it to the horseshoe shaped sanctuary, topped by a massive statue of Cristo Rey standing atop a globe shaped dome. Two angels flank him, each with a crown: one of martyrdom and one of glory.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_31;The two crowns form one, for martyrdom guarantees glory. Viva Cristo Rey!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_4;My things are packed, everything is in order. As the goats of old, I will make my way to Guadalajara.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_41;Guadalajara, Guadalajara!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_41;You have finally arrived at La Perla Tapatía. This ancient city and its surrounding towns have always been the cultural standard of Mexico, with its famed Charros, Mariachi, and Tequila. But it has also always had a significant religious importance as within the Guadalajara Cathedral lays in full view of the public one of the oldest relics in the continent, the body of Santa Inocencia, Roman virgin and martyr.\nThe legend holds that this beautiful child was victim of one of the early persecutions against Catholics when her father killed her after she shared with him her joy of having had her first communion. Her body arrived at Guadalajara from Sacred Rome itself centuries ago and through trials and tribulations, the bones of Santa Inocencia and the sculpted body in which they are protected, have remained safely within the city.\nYour mind wonders if you will be one of the lucky few who Santa Inocencia deems worthy enough to open her eyes to look at.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_41;Take me to the Cathedral! No Charrería, nor Tequila for me… for the time being.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_5;My things are packed, everything is in order. I am ready to follow the silver way to the silver city.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_51;Zacatecas;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_51;You have finally arrived at Zacatecas, ancient city founded when the silver veins around it where discovered. The small town feel this venerable city retains, with its narrow hilly streets and simple one or two-storied buildings, is broken only by the massive churches that dominate over their respective barrios and the city’s skyline.\nBut none stand to rival the massive Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas. Dedicated to La Virgen de la Asunción, the main facade is one of the most detailed in the entire world with a Churriguresque Baroque style in which Dios, as the Eternal father and as a statue of Jesucristo, presides over a collection of statues of Ángeles and Apóstoles that greet the faithful that are to enter the church. The inside is austere and somber, except for the altar which is made up of wooden prisms covered in gold in honour of La Virgen María and the saints.\nSuch beauty has left you speechless.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_51;Dios guides the hands of us mere mortals when we construct his temples!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_6;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will leave my Exvoto in the church alongside the other thousands there will surely be.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_61;San Juan de los Lagos;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_61;Before you see either church or city, you see the pilgrims. Thousands upon thousands in group pilgrimages fill the roads towards the town. Many of them carry Exvotos, images, flowers, and other various offerings they are planning to leave with La Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos after praying to her.\nThe tiny Virgen de la Inmaculada Concepción at display in the Cathedral Basilica was first used by a Fray to convert the indigenous to Catholicism. It is said that a circus gymnast girl once failed a daring pirouette and died a gruesome death, only to be brought back to life by La Virgen.\nYou finally make it past all the other pilgrims and stand in front of her, surrounded by thousands if not millions of Exvotos from previous pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_61;Please accept this cute drawing as my thanks, I made it myself!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_7;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will now go to the city that sleeps under the lover volcanoes.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_71;Puebla de los Ángeles;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_71;You have made it to the city that was traced by the angels themselves, hence the alternative name “Angelópolis”. The Very Noble, Very Loyal, and Very Heroic city of Puebla has always found a way to be a protagonist in the history of Mexico, and so it is also a protagonist of its religiosity.\nYour first stop is in La Parroquia de los Remedios in which you are greeted by El Cristo de la Bala, who legends tell protected a Mexican hero of old from a treacherous foreigners bullet with his smooth face, bullet that yet remains in the figure. Finally you arrive to the Cathedral Basilica of Puebla and you are amazed by its size and majestuosity. Legends say this design was supposed to be the design for the Cathedral in Mexico City, but somehow the papers got mixed up and Puebla received a magnificent cathedra, thus forcing the church to make an even more majestic one for the capital.\nYou have seen it yourself, the architecture is immaculate.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_71;There is no doubt about it, this city was made by the angels!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_8;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will now journey to the city of churches.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_81;Cholula de San Andrés y San Pedro;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_81;You are now arriving to the town of Cholula, famous all across Mexico for the enormous quantity of churches that the city possesses. It is said that a person could attend a different church every single day and not run out of new churches until a year has gone by.\nThe most notable church of them all is El Santuario de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios, built on top of the big hill that overlooks the town. But as you get closer you realise that is no hill, it is actually a semi-buried pyramid, the largest in the entire world in fact.\nYou decide to follow the stone-paved road to the top of the pyramid and enter the beautifully adorned church.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_81;This is a church that is worthy of calling itself the home of Dios!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_9;My things are packed, everything is in order. Now I venture to the rugged hills of Malinalco to get to Chalma.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_91;Chalma;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_91;You have finally arrived at your destination after a long journey through the mountains and hills of Malinalco. The town of Chalma may not be very big or seem very important, but since time immemorial this place has been a place of worship.\nFirst the locals worshipped their local idols in the darkness of the caves that are prevalent all around the small township, but when one day some missionaries found a small figure of Jesucristo in the cross in one of the caves, with all the local idols broken at his feet, the people let Dios into their heart and took the figure and named him El Señor de Chalma.\nThe sanctuary may not be the biggest or fanciest in the world, but you feel the peace of Dios while looking at the old temple flanked by the clear waterway that flows beside it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_91;I shall enter the spring so that El Señor de Chalma may also protect me!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_10;My things are packed, everything is in order. I am ready to walk the bumpy and treacherous roads of Old Veracruz.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_101;Catemaco;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_101;You have finally arrived at Catemaco, the realm of La Santa Muerte and sorcery of all kinds. It is a small town on the shore of the lake of the same name and not too far from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The roads of Old Veracruz test you with steep mountain passes, deep jungles, and mosquito infested regions, but later rewards you with beautiful scenery of waterways, farmland, the coast and beautiful and tranquil towns, just as how La Santa Muerte can be both beautiful and horrid.\nLegends and myths about Catemaco pale in comparison to the reality, in every street and plaza of the town there is a small multitude waiting to pay a witch for their services, be it a Limpia, an Amarre, or just a simple divination.\nThe town is filled to the brim with the spirit of La Santa Muerte and your mind dwells on the inevitable day in which you will finally meet her in person, just as all other mortals.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_101;I will not leave until I find an available witch to attend me!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_20;My things are packed, everything is in order. As the sick and weary of old, I will make my way to the north.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_201;Espinazo;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_201;In the middle of nowhere, between the cities of Saltillo, Piedras Negras, and massive Monterrey, lies the barely inhabited town of Espinazo, birthplace of Fidencismo and final resting place of El Niño Fidencio. The tiny settlement’s population is always at least quintupled every time a large pilgrim group arrives and most of the locals work tending to the needs of the faithful.\nThe town became notorious when Niño Fidencio started to do his miracle works in town, curing illnesses and performing painless surgeries with just fire-treated broken bottles, famously curing one ruler of Old Mexico from his ailments.\nIn the main street lies the church dedicated in his honor and where his bones rest. You enter and see a Cajita being possessed by the spirit of El Niño Fidencio and bathing people in muddy water.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_201;Good thing I brought a towel and a change of clothes!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_30;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will stem the cold tide and visit Ichtus’ natural wonder.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_301;Cabo San Lucas;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_301;The southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula has always received countless visitors to its hot shores but chilly water. Being the point where the Sea of Cortés meets the Pacific Ocean, the ever-constant waves, no doubt with the interference of Icthus himself, have shaped the rocks off the coast creating a beautiful arch, El Arco de Cabo San Lucas.\nBut as Icthus’ wishes his children to become strong and know and rule the waves, the arch, and the minuscule beach underneath it, is always below water except for when the low tide arrives. At the shore one can hire a small boat to ferry you across, but you see some pilgrims save the coin and just make the treacherous swim.\nYou took the middle rout, and rented a small rowboat to get to the arch, and when you step out of it the first thing you see is a tiny seashell and a tiny pearl gleaming in the sands of El Arco de Cabo San Lucas.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_301;This is truly Icthus’ work, I shall make a necklace out of you two!;;;;;;;;;x

#####LATINATE EVENTS#####

EVTTITLE_latinate_1;The Pontifex Maximus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_latinate_1;The history of Eastern Christianity has entered a new chapter. [Root.GetTitledName] has declared themselves Pontfex Maximus, asserting that [Root.GetSheHe] has been divinely selected to lead the Christian away from heresy.

#####FLAGELLANT EVENTS#####

EVTDESC_flagellation_1;Mortification of the Flesh is an act undertaken in order to repent for sins or as a way to share and imitate the Passion of Christ. While the tradition long predates the event, it was only after it that it took the more extreme form practiced by contemporary Penitentes, as instruments of mortification were made bloodier. Penitente Rulers are expected to practice mortification regularly..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_1;I will walk barefoot and wear the Cilice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_flagellation_1;This is the most common and riskless form of Penance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_flagellation_1;I will publically whip myself using the discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_flagellation_1;Self-flagellation is seen as very pious, however it also carries more risk than simply wearing the Cilice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_flagellation_1;I will imitate His Passion and ask to be put in a Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTC_flagellation_1;This is the most extraordinary form of mortification of the flesh, however it also carries higher risk compared to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_2;You spent a long time wearing the Cilice in public, as an act repent and Reparation. It was a painful but rewarding experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_2;Pecador Contempla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_3;Although the original Cilice used in the pre-event world was only meant to cause some discomfort, the ones worn by contemporary Penitentes are meant to cause actual pain and often occasionate bleeding. As you spent a long time wearing the cilice you ended up developing an infection from the wounds it caused. May God take this as an act of repent and Reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_3;Pecador Contempla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_4;In addition to the chain Cilice, you also had to wear a sackcloth and walk barefoot. While walking through somewhat rough terrain, you ended up wounding your feet, and it later developed into a swollen ankle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_4;Pecador Contempla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_5;You practiced mortification through the use of the Penance, a small whip containing seven cords, each representing one of the seven deadly sins as an act repent and Reparation. It was a painful but rewarding experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_6;You practiced mortification through the use of the Penance, a small whip containing seven cords, each representing one of the seven deadly sins. The constant self-flagellation opened a wound, and occasionated an infection. May God take this as an act of repent and Reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_7;You practiced mortification through the use of the Penance, a small whip containing seven cords, each representing one of the seven deadly sins. The constant self-flagellation ended leaving you badly bruised. May God take this as an act of repent and Reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_8;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. Although it was painful, you did not sustain any serious injuries and it left you with new insight over the Passion of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_9;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. It was a very painful experience as it left you severely injured, but it also gave you new insight over the Passion of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_9;He underwent all that pain, only to give us a second chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_10;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. It was a very painful experience as staying in such a position lead to you breaking your ribs, but it also gave you new insight over the Passion of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_13;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. During the re-enactment, you started suffering from severe bleeding. At first everyone thought it to be part of the play only to later realise the bleeding was real and rushing you to a doctor. However it was already too late at that point...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_13;Pecador contempla el dia final.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_15;Your recent mortification of the flesh was a transforming experience for you. Your discipline toughened in response to your physical trauma and you learned to better resist the temptations of the flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_15;I am becoming a better Christian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_21;Penitente rulers are expected to serve as an example to their people and regularly practice Mortification of the Flesh as penance for both his sins and the sins of his people. You however have went too long without performing mortification, which has earned you the disaproval of the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_21;I should have seen this coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

big_brother_sad;Your lack of faith §Rdisturbs§! the Hermano Mayor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

######Justo Armas Event Chain######

justo.1.name;The Prelate Has Had a Vision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.1.desc;The Prelado of Cristo Rey has communicated to the world that he has been visited by Our Lady of Guadalupe who gave him a most important quest to which he will now dedicate his entire life to. He has written detailed instructions for his subordinates in the Prelature in case he passes before completing his mission on this earth. Hundreds of envoys have then begun travelling all across the continent in search of something, but what it is they search is still being kept in total secrecy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo1;Whatever the Prelado needs, Dios will show him the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo1;Should I be worried or has the man gone mad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo1;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_justo1;Why do I have the sudden urge to dress as a Charro?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_justo1;As long as they don't bother my realm, the man can do whatever he wants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.4.name;The Prelate's Envoy in my Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.4.desc;For the past few days an envoy of the Prelado of Cristo Rey, Nepomuceno Miramón, has been a guest here in the [Title.GetBaseName] and has behaved rather strangely, asking courtiers about my family's history and constantly looking and comparing me to a sketch he carries with his person at all times. Finally, he asked for an audience with me and asked what was the reason behind me speaking a language none of my vassals nor neighbours spoke. When I answered that it was an old legacy of the family, he became extremely nervous. He quickly, and stutteringly, told me it was time for him to return to the Prelado, but not to worry, that he would return as soon as he could. He kissed my hand and bowed, before beeding me farewell as "Su Alteza Imperial".;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_justo4;I wonder what got him so spooked about me... Am I that ugly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.5.name;The Prelate Sails Away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.5.desc;Several days ago, the leader of the Cristeros was seen dashing with a small entourage of priest-soldiers led by commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón towards the port of Colima in the Pacific Coast. As soon as they arrived, they chartered a medium sized ship and quickly set sail towards the south. The Prelado was last seen waving towards the multitude of people on the pier and shouting: "My destination is the end of my divine mission! If I succeed it means I have served Dios and Our Lady of Guadalupe well, if I fail... let's pray to Dios I don't fail!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo5;Did he just... abandon us? What is going on?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo5;He just left like that? That is indeed bizarre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo5;What is it with this guy? He is surely up to no good…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_justo5;Is that not the envoy that was at my court a while ago?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_justo5;So he has gone absolutely mad, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.6.name;An Offer You Can Refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.6.desc;This morning the people of (fetch capital) rose to the sound of bells as the tricolor banner of the Prelado of Cristo Rey could be seen in the outskirts of town. Me and my soldiers quickly armored up and rode into what we thought had to surely be an attack force, what we found instead was a large ornate tent and a bunch of unarmed and unarmoured priest-soldiers. Commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón was the first in bowing to me. He led me inside the tent where I was received by Prelado (fetch name) himself. I asked what the reason of their presence within my realm was, and the Prelado simply answered "You, Su Alteza Imperial". He took out a wig and a fake beard and put them on me and once more compared me to the sketch in possession of Nepomuceno Miramón. It was confirmed, I am the last descendant of the last Emperor of México before the restoration of La República in the ancient times before the Event. "Our Lady of Guadalupe sent me to find you, Su Alteza Imperial, she wants you to reclaim your throne and restore México to its holy place", said the Prelado, he continued: "all she's asking for is that you restore Cristo Rey as the official religion of the realm after you conquer it. I will help with the men of my order and make independent Cristero lords swear fealty to you and fight at your side. Commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón will stay here with you and help you organize for the invasion, which should begin by September 2670. So, what say you? Will you answer the call of Dios and Our Lady of Guadalupe?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo6;¡Por Dios, que sí! ¡Viva México!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo6_TT;You shall abandon your realm and embark on an adventure to the §GMexican Empire§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo6;I am honored, but I will decline this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo6_TT;The Prelate and Miramón will be §Rdisappointed§! with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo6;I should just arrest these madmen!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo6_TT;You will arrest both the Prelate and Miramón and turn them in to the Benemérito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.7.name;The Failure of a Prelate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.7.desc;Today Prelado [the_prelate.GetFirstName] and Commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón revealed that, due to the cowardice of a foreign [el_justo.GetTitle] named Justo Armas, they have failed in the divine mission entrusted to the Prelature by Dios and the Virgen de Guadalupe herself and will therefore step down from their posts. The new leader of the Cristeros, Prelado [d_cristo_rey.Holder.GetFirstName] assigned them both to a mission to Brazil, to attempt to convert the great southern empire into the one true faith. \nThe Cristero faithful are baffled, they are still kept in the secret of what the special divine mission was and thus many have lost faith in the church as an institution, there’s even heretical whispers rising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.10.desc;It has come to my attention, thanks to the foreign [el_justo.GetTitle] Justo Armas that the Prelado of Cristo Rey and one of his commander-bishops had been planning a meticulous attack on La República by attempting to recruit him, Justo Armas, and organizing independent Cristero lords inop order to oust me from power and reestablish Cristero control over México. Today the two imprisoned conspirators have been delivered to me and their fates are squarely on my hands, what should their punishment be for attempting to wage war on La República?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo10;They shall die! And the Cristeros shall pay for this treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.11.desc;The ruler of México, Benemérito [e_mexico.holder.GetFirstName] has announced that Prelado [the_prelate.GetFirstName] and his commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón were both found guilty of conspiring to make war on La República by attempting to recruit a foreign [el_justo.GetTitle] by the name of Justo Armas and install him as Emperor. After the sentencing, both men were fusilladed with crossbows and their naked bodies dumped in the Texcoco lake. The Benemérito also claims that the neighboring Cristero realms in El Bajío knew about this conspiracy and therefore will pay in time.\n Meanwhile the Prelature of Cristo Rey has condemned the execution of their leader and an important commander, claiming their deaths as martyrdom. The outrage generated by the Benemérito’s actions has increased the fervor of the Cristeros and eclipsed the failure of Prelado [the_prelate.GetFirstName] in the mission given to the Prelature by the Virgen de Guadalupe. The conflict between Sagrado Corazón and Cristo Rey for the soul of Mexico is just beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the sentencing, Miramón was immediately fusilladed with crossbows and his naked body dumped into the Texcoco lake, while the Prelado was ransomed.\n Cristeros are outraged with the humiliation their church had to go through and specially with how the Prelature completely failed in their divine mission. Prelado [the_prelate.GetFirstName] has since stepped down from his position and left to self-appointed exile, doing missionary work in Brazil. The new Prelado, [d_cristo_rey.Holder.GetFirstName] must now attempt to heal a deeply wounded church, one where whispers of heresy are starting to grow louder and bolder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The new Prelado of the Cristeros assigned them both to do missionary work to Brazil, while he attempts to soften the damage this humiliation has done to the Prelature of Cristo Rey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.31.desc;It had been barely a week after the Prelado left my court and not even Commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón had finished unpacking his luggage when a strange man requested an audience with me regarding the impending invasion of Mexico. The private audience was had in a secluded space away from my courtiers, and only Miramón and myself were in there alongside the exiled nobleman from the Lousiane, Henri Ledonnant.\n He explains that he was sent by the St. Louis Pope [k_papal_state.Holder.GetFirstName] to offer assistance in my expedition. Nepomuceno Miramón questioned the reasons of the Gringo Pope’s interest, and Henri Ledonnant answered that for centuries the See in St. Louis had known of my lineage, and now the Pope wished to see the rightful Emperor on the Mexican throne. He only asked of me that during the invasion of Mexico I sieged down a county with coast in the Gulf of Mexico so that his troops can safely land.\n I asked Nepomuceno Miramón what he thought about this, he did not fully trust envoys of the heretic Gringo Pope, but the invasion will be extremely difficult, maybe these Gringo soldiers will prove decisive in my victory. He ultimately said it was my call as I am “Su Alteza Imperial”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
