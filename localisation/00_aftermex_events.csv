TITLE_DESTAPADO;The Grand Unveiling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TITLE_SELECT_DESTAPADO;Choosing an Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_4;The time has come for the great unveiling of El Tapado. The most powerful and influential figures of La República must now be gathered in the main hall of Chapultepec Castle to witness the ceremony, they must stand with [From.GetTitle]'s choice or plot and scheme to place one of their own as the true successor to La Silla Presidencial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_4;I should warm up my choosing finger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_destape_4;No, this is premature...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_5;The [FromFrom.GetTitle] is planning to reveal [FromFrom.GetHerHis] successor in a grand unveiling. The most powerful figures of the realm will now be gathered in the main hall of Chapultepec Castle to witness the ceremony. Everyone must now either stand with the [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s choice as tradition dictates or plot and scheme to try to place their own choice on the ancient and powerful Silla Presidencial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_5;Let us see who the [FromFrom.GetTitle] has named as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] successor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_6;The most powerful of the political class gather into the chamber awaiting the great unveiling of the next heir to the Silla Presidencial. The crowd falls silent as the [target_benemerito.GetTitle] enters the room, with bated breath all await the "Dedazo" - when the [target_benemerito.GetTitle] will point to the one [target_benemerito.GetSheHe] deems worthy to wear the Imperial Band. The [target_benemerito.GetTitle] gives a brief, rehearsed speech and then points to [target_benemerito.GetHerHis] chosen candidate, shaping the future of Mexico...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_6;The moment has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_7;The [target_benemerito.GetTitle]'s finger is directly pointing toward you. You have been chosen to be the next in line to be the [target_benemerito.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_7;I am at the service of La República.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_8;My finger comes to rest in front of my chosen successor, [From.GetBestName]. Thus, the veil is lifted and all can see who has been chosen to rule after the current [Root.GetTitle]. The lines will quickly be drawn. Should this "Destapado" be supported as the ancient tradition dictates? or is another more worthy to lead? The chamber is emptied after the usual mingling and political schmoozing, yet the dust has yet to settle. Will my choice persevere as has according to tradition? or will it fall prey to political machinations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_destape_8;Let us wait and see what becomes of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_9;The [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s finger comes to rest in front of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] chosen successor, [From.GetBestName]. Thus, the veil is lifted and all can see who has been chosen to rule after the current [FromFrom.GetTitle]. The lines will quickly be drawn. Should this "Destapado" be supported as the ancient tradition dictates? Or is another more worthy to lead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_9;The ancient tradition must be upheld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_destape_9;I will not suffer this fool on the Silla Presidencial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_10;The chamber is emptied after the usual mingling and political schmoozing, but the dust has yet to settle. Will this choice persevere as has according to tradition? or will it fall prey to political machinations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_destape_10;Let us wait and see what becomes of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_11;The grand Destape Ceremony has been cancelled due to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_11;I guess we must wait and see who will be the next to lead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_16;The §YTapado§! - or the "covered one" - is the hidden heir apparent of the Mexican Empire. The Tapado must first be selected from a list of potential candidates and then revealed in the §Y"Destape"§! ceremony when the [ROOT.GetTitle] feels [ROOT.GetHerHis] end draws near. A truly worthy heir must be a powerful vassal, be on the imperial §Ycouncil§!, be a landed §Ycommander§!, have a §Yclaim§! on the Empire, or a cunning Benemérito might try to put a §Yrelative§! on La Silla Presidencial;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DESTAPE_16;It should be the most popular vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DESTAPE_16;It should be someone with strength to lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DESTAPE_16;It should be someone of my own family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_DESTAPE_16;I still need more time to decide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TT_TAPADO_CHOOSE_ANOTHER_DAY;You may select or relieve a Tapado of your choice with a targeted decision on the desired character at any time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_2;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will go see the most sacred city in the continent.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_21;Ciudad de México;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_21;You have arrived to the center of Mexico. You stand now in El Zócalo and in front of you is La Catedral Metropolitana, you enter it and immediately feel in another world. The beautiful crooked majestuosity of it all, it takes you aback, you almost crash with the flags and remains of the First Emperor.\nYou thought nothing would make your heart race more after that, but then you finally arrived to the great Explanada de Guadalupe just in front of the ancient Basilicas. You see thousands and thousands of pilgrims on their knees, they are doing penance so that Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe intercedes for them. Never before had you seen such a beautiful display of faith. You can feel the presence of Dios within all those people, and withing yourself as well.\nYou see the Basilica on the other side of the square, La Tilma de Juan Diego, La Virgen de Guadalupe, awaits you patiently inside. But you must not make her wait for you are only her humble child and she is the Empress of the Americas. Tears roll down your face.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_21;I kneel, and on my knees I begin to walk towards the temple of my faith.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_3;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will make the hike to meet Cristo Rey.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_31;Cristo de la Montaña;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_31;You finally made your way to El Cerro del Cubilete, located not far from either Silao or León, and home to El Santuario de Cristo Rey. While the stone-paved road in the slopes of the mountain may be steep, the occasional glimpse of what awaits you at the top fills your body with stamina to push forwards.\nThe sanctuary is not the first monument of Cristo Rey to be erected in El Cerro del Cubilete, there used to be another one but a tyrannical ruler of Old Mexico destroyed it using dreadful weapons of the Old World. But Cristo Rey and the faith will never be broken and so the current monument stands were the previous one stood.\nYou have finally made it to the horseshoe shaped sanctuary, topped by a massive statue of Cristo Rey standing atop a globe shaped dome. Two angels flank him, each with a crown: one of martyrdom and one of glory.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_31;The two crowns form one, for martyrdom guarantees glory. Viva Cristo Rey!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_4;My things are packed, everything is in order. As the goats of old, I will make my way to Guadalajara.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_41;Guadalajara, Guadalajara!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_41;You have finally arrived at La Perla Tapatía. This ancient city and its surrounding towns have always been the cultural standard of Mexico, with its famed Charros, Mariachi, and Tequila. But it has also always had a significant religious importance as within the Guadalajara Cathedral lays in full view of the public one of the oldest relics in the continent, the body of Santa Inocencia, Roman virgin and martyr.\nThe legend holds that this beautiful child was victim of one of the early persecutions against Catholics when her father killed her after she shared with him her joy of having had her first communion. Her body arrived at Guadalajara from Sacred Rome itself centuries ago and through trials and tribulations, the bones of Santa Inocencia and the sculpted body in which they are protected, have remained safely within the city.\nYour mind wonders if you will be one of the lucky few who Santa Inocencia deems worthy enough to open her eyes to look at.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_41;Take me to the Cathedral! No Charrería, nor Tequila for me… for the time being.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_5;My things are packed, everything is in order. I am ready to follow the silver way to the silver city.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_51;Zacatecas;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_51;You have finally arrived at Zacatecas, ancient city founded when the silver veins around it where discovered. The small town feel this venerable city retains, with its narrow hilly streets and simple one or two-storied buildings, is broken only by the massive churches that dominate over their respective barrios and the city’s skyline.\nBut none stand to rival the massive Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas. Dedicated to La Virgen de la Asunción, the main facade is one of the most detailed in the entire world with a Churriguresque Baroque style in which Dios, as the Eternal father and as a statue of Jesucristo, presides over a collection of statues of Ángeles and Apóstoles that greet the faithful that are to enter the church. The inside is austere and somber, except for the altar which is made up of wooden prisms covered in gold in honour of La Virgen María and the saints.\nSuch beauty has left you speechless.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_51;Dios guides the hands of us mere mortals when we construct his temples!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_6;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will leave my Exvoto in the church alongside the other thousands there will surely be.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_61;San Juan de los Lagos;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_61;Before you see either church or city, you see the pilgrims. Thousands upon thousands in group pilgrimages fill the roads towards the town. Many of them carry Exvotos, images, flowers, and other various offerings they are planning to leave with La Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos after praying to her.\nThe tiny Virgen de la Inmaculada Concepción at display in the Cathedral Basilica was first used by a Fray to convert the indigenous to Catholicism. It is said that a circus gymnast girl once failed a daring pirouette and died a gruesome death, only to be brought back to life by La Virgen.\nYou finally make it past all the other pilgrims and stand in front of her, surrounded by thousands if not millions of Exvotos from previous pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_61;Please accept this cute drawing as my thanks, I made it myself!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_7;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will now go to the city that sleeps under the lover volcanoes.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_71;Puebla de los Ángeles;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_71;You have made it to the city that was traced by the angels themselves, hence the alternative name “Angelópolis”. The Very Noble, Very Loyal, and Very Heroic city of Puebla has always found a way to be a protagonist in the history of Mexico, and so it is also a protagonist of its religiosity.\nYour first stop is in La Parroquia de los Remedios in which you are greeted by El Cristo de la Bala, who legends tell protected a Mexican hero of old from a treacherous foreigners bullet with his smooth face, bullet that yet remains in the figure. Finally you arrive to the Cathedral Basilica of Puebla and you are amazed by its size and majestuosity. Legends say this design was supposed to be the design for the Cathedral in Mexico City, but somehow the papers got mixed up and Puebla received a magnificent cathedra, thus forcing the church to make an even more majestic one for the capital.\nYou have seen it yourself, the architecture is immaculate.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_71;There is no doubt about it, this city was made by the angels!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_8;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will now journey to the city of churches.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_81;Cholula de San Andrés y San Pedro;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_81;You are now arriving to the town of Cholula, famous all across Mexico for the enormous quantity of churches that the city possesses. It is said that a person could attend a different church every single day and not run out of new churches until a year has gone by.\nThe most notable church of them all is El Santuario de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios, built on top of the big hill that overlooks the town. But as you get closer you realise that is no hill, it is actually a semi-buried pyramid, the largest in the entire world in fact.\nYou decide to follow the stone-paved road to the top of the pyramid and enter the beautifully adorned church.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_81;This is a church that is worthy of calling itself the home of Dios!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_9;My things are packed, everything is in order. Now I venture to the rugged hills of Malinalco to get to Chalma.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_91;Chalma;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_91;You have finally arrived at your destination after a long journey through the mountains and hills of Malinalco. The town of Chalma may not be very big or seem very important, but since time immemorial this place has been a place of worship.\nFirst the locals worshipped their local idols in the darkness of the caves that are prevalent all around the small township, but when one day some missionaries found a small figure of Jesucristo in the cross in one of the caves, with all the local idols broken at his feet, the people let Dios into their heart and took the figure and named him El Señor de Chalma.\nThe sanctuary may not be the biggest or fanciest in the world, but you feel the peace of Dios while looking at the old temple flanked by the clear waterway that flows beside it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_91;I shall enter the spring so that El Señor de Chalma may also protect me!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_10;My things are packed, everything is in order. I am ready to walk the bumpy and treacherous roads of Old Veracruz.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_101;Catemaco;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_101;You have finally arrived at Catemaco, the realm of La Santa Muerte and sorcery of all kinds. It is a small town on the shore of the lake of the same name and not too far from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The roads of Old Veracruz test you with steep mountain passes, deep jungles, and mosquito infested regions, but later rewards you with beautiful scenery of waterways, farmland, the coast and beautiful and tranquil towns, just as how La Santa Muerte can be both beautiful and horrid.\nLegends and myths about Catemaco pale in comparison to the reality, in every street and plaza of the town there is a small multitude waiting to pay a witch for their services, be it a Limpia, an Amarre, or just a simple divination.\nThe town is filled to the brim with the spirit of La Santa Muerte and your mind dwells on the inevitable day in which you will finally meet her in person, just as all other mortals.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_101;I will not leave until I find an available witch to attend me!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_20;My things are packed, everything is in order. As the sick and weary of old, I will make my way to the north.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_201;Espinazo;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_201;In the middle of nowhere, between the cities of Saltillo, Piedras Negras, and massive Monterrey, lies the barely inhabited town of Espinazo, birthplace of Fidencismo and final resting place of El Niño Fidencio. The tiny settlement’s population is always at least quintupled every time a large pilgrim group arrives and most of the locals work tending to the needs of the faithful.\nThe town became notorious when Niño Fidencio started to do his miracle works in town, curing illnesses and performing painless surgeries with just fire-treated broken bottles, famously curing one ruler of Old Mexico from his ailments.\nIn the main street lies the church dedicated in his honor and where his bones rest. You enter and see a Cajita being possessed by the spirit of El Niño Fidencio and bathing people in muddy water.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_201;Good thing I brought a towel and a change of clothes!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_30;My things are packed, everything is in order. I will stem the cold tide and visit Ichtus’ natural wonder.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mxpilgrimage_301;Cabo San Lucas;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mxpilgrimage_301;The southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula has always received countless visitors to its hot shores but chilly water. Being the point where the Sea of Cortés meets the Pacific Ocean, the ever-constant waves, no doubt with the interference of Icthus himself, have shaped the rocks off the coast creating a beautiful arch, El Arco de Cabo San Lucas.\nBut as Icthus’ wishes his children to become strong and know and rule the waves, the arch, and the minuscule beach underneath it, is always below water except for when the low tide arrives. At the shore one can hire a small boat to ferry you across, but you see some pilgrims save the coin and just make the treacherous swim.\nYou took the middle rout, and rented a small rowboat to get to the arch, and when you step out of it the first thing you see is a tiny seashell and a tiny pearl gleaming in the sands of El Arco de Cabo San Lucas.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mxpilgrimage_301;This is truly Icthus’ work, I shall make a necklace out of you two!;;;;;;;;;x

#####LATINATE EVENTS#####

EVTTITLE_latinate_1;The Pontifex Maximus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_latinate_1;The history of Eastern Christianity has entered a new chapter. [Root.GetTitledName] has declared themselves Pontfex Maximus, asserting that [Root.GetSheHe] has been divinely selected to lead the Christian away from heresy. [Root.GetHerHisCap] claim has been eagerly accepted by all followers of the Latinate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_ceticreformlatinate;Latin is the language of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#####FLAGELLANT EVENTS#####

EVTDESC_flagellation_1;Mortification of the Flesh is an act undertaken in order to repent for sins or as a way to share and imitate the Passion of Christ. While the tradition long predates the event, it was only after it that it took the more extreme form practiced by contemporary Penitentes, as instruments of mortification were made bloodier. Penitente Rulers are expected to practice mortification regularly..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_1;I will walk barefoot and wear the Cilice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_flagellation_1;This is the most common and riskless form of Penance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_flagellation_1;I will publically whip myself using the discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_flagellation_1;Self-flagellation is seen as very pious, however it also carries more risk than simply wearing the Cilice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_flagellation_1;I will imitate His Passion and ask to be put in a Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTC_flagellation_1;This is the most extraordinary form of mortification of the flesh, however it also carries higher risk compared to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_2;You spent a long time wearing the Cilice in public, as an act repent and Reparation. It was a painful but rewarding experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_2;Pecador Contempla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_3;Although the original Cilice used in the pre-event world was only meant to cause some discomfort, the ones worn by contemporary Penitentes are meant to cause actual pain and often occasionate bleeding. As you spent a long time wearing the cilice you ended up developing an infection from the wounds it caused. May God take this as an act of repent and Reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_3;Pecador Contempla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_4;In addition to the chain Cilice, you also had to wear a sackcloth and walk barefoot. While walking through somewhat rough terrain, you ended up wounding your feet, and it later developed into a swollen ankle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_4;Pecador Contempla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_5;You practiced mortification through the use of the Penance, a small whip containing seven cords, each representing one of the seven deadly sins as an act repent and Reparation. It was a painful but rewarding experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_6;You practiced mortification through the use of the Penance, a small whip containing seven cords, each representing one of the seven deadly sins. The constant self-flagellation opened a wound, and occasionated an infection. May God take this as an act of repent and Reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_7;You practiced mortification through the use of the Penance, a small whip containing seven cords, each representing one of the seven deadly sins. The constant self-flagellation ended leaving you badly bruised. May God take this as an act of repent and Reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_8;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. Although it was painful, you did not sustain any serious injuries and it left you with new insight over the Passion of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_9;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. It was a very painful experience as it left you severely injured, but it also gave you new insight over the Passion of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_9;He underwent all that pain, only to give us a second chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_10;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. It was a very painful experience as staying in such a position lead to you breaking your ribs, but it also gave you new insight over the Passion of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flagellation_13;You asked to be publically crucified for a few minutes, a form of mortification considered by the Penitentes to be both the most pious and risky. During the re-enactment, you started suffering from severe bleeding. At first everyone thought it to be part of the play only to later realise the bleeding was real and rushing you to a doctor. However it was already too late at that point...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_13;Pecador contempla el dia final.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_15;Your recent mortification of the flesh was a transforming experience for you. Your discipline toughened in response to your physical trauma and you learned to better resist the temptations of the flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_15;I am becoming a better Christian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_flagellation_21;Penitente rulers are expected to serve as an example to their people and regularly practice Mortification of the Flesh as penance for both his sins and the sins of his people. You however have went too long without performing mortification, which has earned you the disaproval of the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_flagellation_21;I should have seen this coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

big_brother_sad;Your lack of faith §Rdisturbs§! the Hermano Mayor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

######Justo Armas Event Chain######

justo.1.name;The Prelate Has Had a Vision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.1.desc;The Prelado of Cristo Rey has announced to the world that he has been blessed with a sacred vision from Our Lady of Guadalupe, igniting within him a profound purpose to embark on a quest of the utmost importance, to which he has solemnly sworn his lifelong dedication. He has scrupulously documented instructions for his most trusted subordinates within the Prelature should he die and leave his mission unfinished. Even now, hundreds of envoys have set out on journeys across the continent in search of something, the specifics of which are being kept in absolute secrecy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo1;Whatever the Prelado needs, Dios will show him the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo1;Has the man succumbed to madness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo1;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_justo1;Why do I have the sudden urge to dress as a Charro?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_justo1;As long as they don't bother my realm, the man can do whatever he wants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.4.name;The Prelate's Envoy in my Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.4.desc;For the past few days, an envoy of the Prelado of Cristo Rey, Nepomuceno Miramón, has been a guest here in the [Title.GetBaseName]. His behavior has been rather peculiar, as he has been inquiring about my family's history with the courtiers and constantly comparing me to a sketch he carries with him at all times. Finally, he requested an audience with me and questioned the reason behind my use of a language that none of my vassals nor neighbors speak. When I explained that it was an old legacy of the family, he became extremely agitated. In a rushed and stuttering manner, he expressed that it was time for him to return to the Prelado, but reassured me not to worry and promised to come back as soon as he could. With a gesture of respect, he kissed my hand, bowed, and bid me farewell as "Su Alteza Imperial.";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_justo4;What's this about “your imperial highness?”. What empire could he possibly mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.5.name;The Prelate Sails Away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.5.desc;Several days ago, the Cristero leader was observed dashing with a small entourage of militant priest-soldiers, commanded by Bishop Nepomuceno Miramón, towards the port of Manzanillo on the Pacific Coast. Upon their arrival, they promptly chartered a medium-sized ship and swiftly set sail towards the south. The Prelado was last seen waving towards the multitude of people on the pier, shouting, "My destination marks the culmination of my divine mission! If I succeed, it will signify that I have faithfully served Dios and Our Lady of Guadalupe. If I fail... let us pray to Dios that I do not!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo5;Why such secrecy? We need him here with us as our leader!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo5;He left just like that? That is indeed bizarre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo5;What's his motive here? He seems to be up to something suspicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_justo5;Is that not the envoy that was at my court a while ago?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_justo5;Has he, in fact, lost his sanity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.6.name;An Offer You Can Refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.6.desc;Nepomuceno Miramón was the first to bow before me, followed by the Prelado. Intrigued by their presence, I inquired about the reason. The Prelado simply responded, "Your Imperial Highness." It was then confirmed: I am of royal lineage, descending from the last Emperor of México prior to the restoration of La República in ancient times, before the Event.\n"The Virgin of Guadalupe has compelled me to seek you out," declared the Prelado. "you must reclaim your rightful throne and restore México to its sacred oaths." He continued, "All we ask is that, after recovering your birthright, you reinstate the Prelature of Cristo Rey as the final arbiter in the matters of the one true faith. I will lend my support through the militant wing of my order and rally independent Cristero lords to pledge their loyalty to you.

justo.7.name;The Failure of a Prelate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.7.desc;Today, Prelado [the_prelate.GetFirstName] and Commander-Bishop Nepomuceno Miramón have made a solemn announcement. They revealed that, regrettably, their divine mission to defend Mexico from what they perceive as heresy has ended in failure, primarily due to the perceived treachery of a foreign figure known as Justo Armas. As a result, they have decided to step down from their esteemed positions.\nThe newly appointed leader of the Cristeros, Prelado [d_cristo_rey.Holder.GetFirstName], has tasked them with a new mission: a journey to Brazil. Their objective is to establish an ecumenical dialogue with the great southern empire and implore its emperor to renounce any heretical beliefs.\nThe faithful Cristeros find themselves bewildered by this turn of events. The nature of the conspiracy has caused many to question their faith in the prelature as an institution. Whispers of heresy have even begun to emerge, further exacerbating the uncertainty among the devoted followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.10.desc;I have received crucial information from the foreign individual, [el_justo.GetTitle] Justo Armas, shedding light on a grave matter. It has come to my attention that the Prelado of Cristo Rey and one of his commander-bishops were engaged in a meticulously planned conspiracy. Their objective was to orchestrate an attack on La República by attempting to recruit Justo Armas and rallying independent Cristero lords, with the ultimate goal of dethroning me and restoring Cristero dominion over México. Today, I hold the two imprisoned conspirators in my custody, and it falls upon me to decide their fates. What punishment should be meted out for their audacious attempt to wage war against La República?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the sentencing, both men were fusilladed with crossbows. The Benemérito also claims that the neighboring Cristero realms in El Bajío were implicated in this conspiracy and therefore will pay in time.\nMeanwhile, the Cristeros condemned the executions, claiming their deaths as martyrdom. The outrage generated by the Benemérito's actions has increased the fervor of the Cristeros and eclipsed the failure of the Prelature in their sacred mission. The conflict between Sagrado Corazón and Cristo Rey for the soul of Mexico is just beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.12.desc;The ruler of Mexico, Benemérito [e_mexico.Holder.GetBestName], has made a grave announcement, revealing the guilt of the Prelado of the Prelature of Cristo Rey and his commander-bishop Nepomuceno Miramón in a conspiracy to wage war against La República. Their plot involved recruiting a foreign individual named Justo Armas, with the intention of installing him as Emperor. Following their sentencing, Miramón faced immediate execution by fusillade of crossbow bolts, his naked body hung and displayed in Iztapalapa, while the Prelado was imprisoned and held on ransom.\nThe Cristeros, deeply outraged by the humiliation endured by their prelature and the failure in their divine mission, have witnessed the Prelado [the_prelate.GetFirstName] stepping down from his position. He has chosen exile, engaging in missionary work in Brazil. Now, the new Prelado, [d_cristo_rey.Holder.GetFirstName], faces the daunting task of healing a community that has been deeply wounded, where whispers of heresy grow louder and bolder by the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.13.desc;The Benemérito of Mexico has made a surprising announcement, declaring that both the Prelado and his commander-bishop, Nepomuceno Miramón, have been granted pardons for the alleged crime of waging war against La República. The justification behind this decision lies in the fact that the testimonial evidence provided by a treacherous foreign noble named Justo Armas, who implicated them, is deemed untrustworthy due to his reputation as a coward.\nHaving regained their freedom, the Prelado and the Commander-bishop lamented the unfortunate news that their divine mission entrusted to the Prelature by Dios and the Virgen de Guadalupe has met failure, primarily due to the cowardice of Justo Armas. Consequently, they have chosen to step down from their esteemed positions. The new Prelado of the Cristeros has assigned them to engage in missionary work in Brazil, while he endeavors to mitigate the repercussions of this humiliating ordeal on the Prelature of Cristo Rey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.31.desc;A mysterious man sought an audience with me concerning the imminent invasion of Mexico. The meeting took place in a secluded location, far from the presence of my courtiers, with only Miramón and myself accompanying the exiled nobleman from Lousiane, Henri Ledonnant.\nHe had been dispatched by the Pope in St. Louis to offer support for my expedition. Nepomuceno Miramón questioned their motives, and Ledonnant explained that St. Louis had been aware of my lineage for centuries, and now they desired to see the rightful Emperor ascend the Mexican throne. His sole request was for me to secure a coastal county in the Gulf of Mexico during the invasion, enabling his troops to safely land.\nI sought Miramón's counsel, as he harbored reservations toward envoys from the heretic Gringo Pope, but ultimately left the decision in my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_justo57;It seems Deus did not Vult…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_justo57;A Prelate as king? Now that is a ridiculous idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.58.name;The Conqueror of Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.58.desc;The roads on the Mexican frontier and the ports in the Mexican coasts are filled to the brim by fleeing soldiers in battered armor. Cristeros and Catholics alike have been soundly defeated by the foreign conqueror of La República, Justo Armas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo58;It seems our endeavours were not favoured by God…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.59.name;The Latino Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.59.desc;Not since the times before the Event has the Catholic Pope set foot in Mexico, but this was for a special occasion—the proper coronation of Justo Armas.\nAfter the defeat of the Cristeros, the Prelate of Cristo Rey once again fled, and the lands of all rebelling Cristero vassals have been distributed to the commanders who initially invaded with Henri Ledonnant. Now, the army has been reorganized into the Emperor’s personal guard, El Santo Oficio.\nThe era of "La República" is over and all Mexicans have finally been forced to confront this truth. The birth of this new "Latino Empire" heralds a new age, firmly grounded in the divine right of kings, and sanctified by the Pope himself. Justo Armas ascended to the throne, embodying the sacred authority entrusted by a higher power. As the Pope proclaimed during the coronation, "¡México siempre fiel!" - "Ever faithful Mexico!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo59;No! How could things have gone so wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo59;The throne of the Empress of the Americas is reclaimed. Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo59;La República will be reorganised into the §GFirst Latino Empire§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo59_TT;The Mexican Empire will be replaced by the Latino Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_justo59;¡Pobre México! ¡Tan lejos de Dios y tan cerca de gringos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_justo59;Is this it? Is this how Mexico finally ends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.60.name;Not Latino but indeed an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.60.desc;The bloodline of the last emperor of ancient Mexico, Justo Armas, has once again retreated to El Salvador, as his loyalist forces were decimated by the cunning adventurers comprising the Catholic Friends of Mexico. The Prelate of Cristo Rey was compelled to flee, while the Catholics seized all Cristero lands and redistributed them among their now feuding commanders. The ensuing chaos forced the Pope to journey southward, issuing a decree that abolished La República and established a feudal Latino Empire. Additionally, the Catholic Friends of Mexico were disbanded, giving rise to El Santo Oficio, a special body under the Emperor's control. \nWhile the foreign rulers now governing the former Mexico rejoice in the Pope's decrees, native Mexicans harbor discontent. The prospect of further conflicts looms on the horizon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_justo60;Mexico is not yet dead, it lives in every single one of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.62.name;Offer of Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.62.desc;The name Justo Armas has spread far and wide, upsetting the balance of power in Central America and beyond. Ruminating in my camp, I am suddenly confronted by an emissary from a far-off land: Brazil. The emissary praises the name of Justo Armas and offers Brazilian support in exchange for a marriage alliance. I have not considered the question of marriage, but every prince should have a wife, after all. With some flair, the emissary presents a painting of the princess being offered in the alliance, and the lady is very fetching, a brunette. On the other hand, Brazil is very distant, and this is, at the end of the day, just a painting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo62;I accept this proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo62_TT;Your bride shall arrive in a few days;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo62;A painting? Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo62_TT;You'll be able to freely choose your spouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

justo.64.name;The Princess Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
justo.64.desc;A small Brazilian fleet arrives to escort your new wife to you. As the ships make landfall, I rush to board the ship and greet my bride. A feeling of profound disappointment washes over me as I see my bride: she looks nothing like the portrait. The portrait was slim, the princess was overweight, the portrait was lofty, the princess was short, the portrait was pretty, the princess was intensely plain. My expectations are crushed, and the princess notices instantly, bursting into tears. After some brief comforting and returning to my capital, we got to know one another, and I discovered some mutual interests and her continued love for me despite our first meeting. I feel swindled, but is annulment the right move?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_justo64;The wedding is on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_justo64;This was not what I was promised.!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMXR.215;Though [Root.GetSheHe] rose to power as an outsider without the express approval of the previous ruler, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has shrewdly been able to assert [Root.GetHerHim]self as the new political establishment in México.

adelita.3_DESC_A;It's with a heavy heart that I visit the Adelita, [my_adelita.GetFirstName].

adelita.3_DESC_B;Concerned about her absence in the training grounds recently, I visit the Adelita [my_adelita.GetFirstName]. The enemy claimed her right eye, but I didn't expect it to get to her...

adelita.3_DESC_C;After her injury, I made certain that the Adelita [my_adelita.GetFirstName] was fitted with a wooden leg of the finest quality, yet I haven't seen her around much lately.
