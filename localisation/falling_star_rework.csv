EVTDESC_cosmic_oracle;Although it had unified the pre-Event alien cults, the Falling Star faith had often debated how they should be led as a collective community, believing that only a prophet anointed by the Precursors could lead them. These alien worshipers have now found their leader, who reportedly walked into the ancient fortress at Groom Lake and stayed there for three days, emerging afterwards and claiming that they were anointed the new Cosmic Oracle. Whether or not these claims are true, many Falling Star adherents are rallying around them, and a new age of grand-scale holy wars in the name of their extraterrestrial gods has been declared - the Outer Invasions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
