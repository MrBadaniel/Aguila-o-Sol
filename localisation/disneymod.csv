EVTDESCdisneymod.3;After centuries of decay and misuse by the uncultured and unimaginative tyrants of California, the remnants of the first Magic Kingdom have been returned to us! Here our elders may relive the memories of the Old World, and here our chuldfen may savor the promise of the future. While most of the Chairman’s first triumph was destroyed in the days after the Event, there is a last, powerful testament to his imagination left, saved by a wise follower of a prophet in the days just by the Event—the Sword in the Stone! While it may take years, someday we may restore it to it’s former glory.Gaul, long thought forever lost to Roman rule, has submitted to the [Root.GetTitle] and been incorporated back into the Empire. The province has changed much since Caesar campaigned in this land over a thousand years ago, but no longer will it suffer under the rule of upstart kings or false emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCdisneymod.4;While the lands of Haymarket were never conquered by our forebears, we have finally wrested control over the Capital from the sons of those covetous enemies of progress, who have led America to ruin by worshipping their statues and crosses. With the capital in hand and more importantly, the dreams of our fathers fulfilled, we can finally begin to lead America into a true age of progress. The lives lost on this battlefield may now be honored in the manner that befits them—by building another mighty park atop their graves, to honor their sacrifices for all time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCdisneymod.5;At last, we have finally reclaimed the birthplace of the Founder, the man who wished upon the first star. While it took some research to find it, his birth home has been found—a small, dilapidated old house, centuries old and almost destroyed by the ravages of the Event. The faithful have already been flocking here, leaving art for him to weave into reality in the Tomorrow. We may begin rebuilding his old home and bringing Chicago into the Great, Big, Beautiful Tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

phantasmic_DESC;Phantasmic is a faith based upon a reverence America and its foremost prophet, Walt. Through his parables and remarkable magical projections, Walt preached individualism, decency,  love for the fellow man, and a respect for family and nation.Walt eventually ascended to godhood himself but not before leaving behind the Park, heaven on earth, for his followers to care for. Since then, the Phantasmics have acted as the stewards for Walt’s legacy in the form of the Park, and they strive to keep his vision of America alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

disney_adult_desc;n a chilling, enigmatic sequence, these fragmented verses weave a haunting narrative. An eerie atmosphere unfolds as the instructions demand attention and obedience, hinting at a world of concealed intentions and ominous implications. With phrases like "Welcome to the circus," "Power down, Are you feeling nervous?" and "We all scream for ice cream," a disconcerting sense of foreboding permeates the scene, hinting at a hidden agenda. The verses speak of manipulation, a plea to serve, and an unsettling shift in roles, wherein one takes the place of another, suggesting a mysterious and unsettling power play. The repeated motif of being 'below the surface' in a place 'built without purpose' implies a deeper, darker layer to this cryptic scenario. Themes of control, deception, and an ominous unknown presence pervade these enigmatic lines, leaving an unsettling impression on the reader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Renaissancist
renaissancist;Renaissancist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renaissancist_DESC;Renaissancist is a faith that branched off of Phantasmic, claiming the eponymous Eisner as their prophet rather than Walt. The Renaissancists claim that Eisner brought about a Golden Age to America superior to even Walt’s efforts. Eisner’s parables are actually accepted generally by mainstream Phantasmics, but the primary difference between the two besides their choice of prophet is their method of expansion. Renaissancists prefer aggressive expansion and acquisition.versus the proselytization and preservation advocated by Phantasmics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
