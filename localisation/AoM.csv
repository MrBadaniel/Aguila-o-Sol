celebrate_st_john_baptiste_day_desc;Saint John Baptiste is known best for baptisting Christ, and for being the praton Saint of old Quebec. Although this feat may seem rather remote and disconnected from the modern age, Saint John The Baptist is nonetheless one of the most popular saints in all of Christendom, and his feast day is considered a major holiday in most of Old Quebec.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_1;Nobody remembers why Saint John Baptiste came to be so well-regarded in Old Quebec, but his feast day draws large crowds each year. Saint John Baptiste Day is traditionally celebrated with a joyous procession through the streets followed by a series of raucous nighttime feasts and bonfires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_1;I can't wait to see the bards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_2;The annual Saint John Baptiste Day procession has begun. Your capital's streets are filled with pilgrims from across the land, and the air is filled with the sounds of cheers and ancient ballads. Many of the pilgrims make a large show of waving the Carillon Sacred Heart Flag. The Banner that depicts the Sacred-Heart of Christ along with the flag of old Quebec.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_2;Oh, marvelous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_3;Night has fallen, and the procession has come to an end. The people are now heading to local taverns for the start of the second half of the celebration, the feasts. These "feasts" usually devolve into drunken, hedonistic revelry, so more religious [Root.Religon.GetName]s frown on them. However, they are still an integral part of the celebrations for most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_3;To the tavern!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_st_john_baptiste_3;I think I'll pass this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_4;You wake up in an alleyway, with the sun shining overhead and your head pounding in pain. Your memory slowly begins to return to you. You went to a tavern last night after the Saint John Baptiste Day procession. Then you went to another tavern... and another tavern... You wince in pain after glancing up at the sky. You should probably get some rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_4;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_st_john_baptiste_4;I know an excellent remedy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_5;You wake up in an alleyway, with the sun shining overhead and your entire body aching in pain. Your memory slowly begins to return to you. Someone at the tavern started a fight with you... or perhaps you started a fight with them? In any case, the entire tavern ended up joining the melee, and now you're paying the price...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_5;I don't think I can walk this off...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_6;You wake up in your bed, feeling tired yet oddly happy. Your memory begins to return to you. You had a great time at the tavern! You sang many ballads, told a few somewhat embellished stories, and were generally the center of attention all night. And the best part? You don't even have a hangover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_6;I can't wait for next year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_st_john_baptiste_7;You wake up in an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar room... next to an unfamiliar person. As you struggle to remember what you did last night, you hear a crude-sounding, alcohol-scented voice from the other side of the bed. "Morning there, [Root.GetLadLass]. You wanna go again? I haven't had a tumble that good in ages, and that's really saying something.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_7;Uh... how about breakfast?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_st_john_baptiste_7;Uh... how about breakfast?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_st_john_baptiste_8;I am proud of my child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
