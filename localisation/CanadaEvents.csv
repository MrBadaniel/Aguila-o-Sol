EVTDESCATECAD.000;Supporters of the Maroons and Silver Hockey teams have clashed at the Scotia and riots have broken out! The City Guard is fighting to contain the situation, but the Mounties are also standing by. They would make mincemeat of any hooligans before the riot has a chance of spreading to other districts, but there could be significant collateral damage...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATECAD.000;Unleash the Mounties.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBATECAD.000;The City Guard can handle it.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPATECAD.001;The Mounties prepare for battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATECAD.001;Hundreds of rioting Hockey supporters are hacked down as the Sabre-wielding Mounties charge into their ranks. Many attempt to flee, but the Mounties give chase and show no mercy to those they catch. The streets are littered with the mangled corpses of hooligans... and a few dozen innocent bystanders. The Mounties are a blunt hammer to be wielded with care.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATECAD.001;Such is the fate of those who oppose me..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPATECAD.002;The City Guard rallies.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATECAD.002;The City Guard pulls in reinforcement from the other districts and finally manage to disperse the rioting crowds. Many neighborhoods are burning and looting is widespread in those districts the Guard was forced to abandon, but the loss of life is relatively small.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATECAD.002;Centuries from now, hooliganism will be extinct.;;;;;;;;;x

ATECADTITLE.300;Ontario has fallen!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATECAD.300;Ontario has fallen! After decades of instability and unrest the ancient Dominion has finaly fallen. With the death of Albert Soady, his sons spent years preparing an invasion to seek revenge. To the horror of the Ontarians and all Remembrants they have succeeded, butchering thousands in the streets of Tarono and carting off thousands of pounds of gold and a great many slaves back home. In the east Ontarian Lords have gained independence though many Remembrants tremble wondering whether God is merely chastising them, or has abandoned them.;;;;;;;;;x
