EVTDESCATECAD.300;Ontario has fallen! After decades of instability and unrest the ancient Dominion has finaly fallen. With the death of Albert Soady, his sons spent years preparing an invasion to seek revenge. To the horror of the Ontarians and all Remembrants they have succeeded, butchering thousands in the streets of Tarono and carting off thousands of pounds of gold and a great many slaves back home. In the east Ontarian Lords have gained independence though many Remembrants tremble wondering whether God is merely chastising them, or has abandoned them.;;;;;;;;;x
