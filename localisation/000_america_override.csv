angeline_DESC;The Theresines, emerged after the Ursuline order became the main expression of catholicism in Quebecr. However, they live very different lives from their Ursuline cousins. Whereas the Ursulines emphasize the monastic lifestyle and the primacy of the Church, Theresines more strongly favor cohabitation with the natural world. They diverge in the use of The Lisieux Rite, innovating mainly in practices if not wholly in beliefs, due to the influence of other faiths near itself. The adherents of the rite believe that the natural world is inhabited by holy spirits, as a creation of God, and thus strive the most to take care of it. The temples of the faith are surrounded with beautiful gardens, and it's considered a sin to be wasteful and needlessly harm nature. More controversially the nuns engage in ecstatic rituals where they allow themselves to be possessed by the spirits of angels, saints and, even more rarely, demons, in order to seek aid, counsel regarding earthly matters, and strengthen their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

apostolic_DESC;Anchietans are heirs to the Catholic Church in Brazil, the predominant religion of the country for much of its history. Initially uniting under the Patriarch of South America and the Particularists, the Anchietans eventually separated over the issue of the Particularists openly sanctioning certain folk practices, allegedly violating the sacred ancient traditions of the Catholic faith, and the recurring issue of political authority. Now effectively self-governing, Anchietans claim to adhere more closely to the ancient traditions of the Catholic Church while still having influences from their own Brazilian folk traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
