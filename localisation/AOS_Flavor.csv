#Montane
montane;Montane;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
montane_DESC;Long after the Sundering, the Mountain Fathers descended from the Rocky Mountains and preached their wisdom to the masses. Their origins were obscure, but their message was clear: the heavens were divine and the closer one was to them, the more holy. They preached of a loving God whose form encompasses the entire Earth, most importantly the sky. Since the Mountain Fathers? descent, non-monks have adopted the faith as their own though it retains a strong monastic tradition in its homeland. This homeland is protected zealously, as the Depths would like nothing more than to sever their connection to heaven. Montanes revere Jesus as the son of God and see his ascent into heaven as vindication of their message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

olympian_DESC;In the golden age of old America gods walked the land champions of mortal prowess who competed against each other in the great tournament of the Olympics for the favor of Nike goddess of victory and Therun the all-seeing all-conquering paragon of mankind. When the Event which the Olympians call Ragnarok struck down the old world many of the hero-gods of old sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Those gods that remain preside over a world full of trials and monsters one that those humans who still survive will test themselves against. All have the potential to perfect themselves in the manner of the champions of old the ascend to the status of hero-god and restore the golden age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Latinates
latinate;Latinate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
latinate_DESC;When the Deluge severed contact between the New World and Rome, Catholicism entered an age of uncertainty. That led some to retreat into tradition, particularly the liturgy of the church. Latinates see Ecclesiastical Latin as a divine language with the abilities such as curing illnesses, calming madness, and driving out demons. Opinion differs among Latinates on whether Latin is connected to the Holy Spirit, the original Adamic language, or the word of God himself. The Latinates retain their own priesthood and continue to practice the Tridentine Mass while praying for the return of the Pontifex Maximus, who they believe will reemerge before the Second Coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

#Romano-Humanism
romanohumanist;Romano-Humanism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
romanohumanist_DESC;Romano-Humanism is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and a yearning for the world that was lost in the Event. Romano-Humanists see themselves as the inheritors of the philosophical legacy of those who came before them, bearers of the twin torches of Wisdom and Passion. That view led them to a belief that the man, through study and deep introspection, could reach a sublime state of enlightenment that could allow them to push back the ignorance and decay of the Event. This deeply individualistic pursuit of knowledge led to a complex system of mystery cults, each of which approached the ultimate aspiration of the faith in their own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#Kinemite

kinemite_DESC;The Americans once crowded around great mirrors and scrying stones with religious compulsion and in the searing light of ancient magic they witnessed an endless series of rapturous wonders. Empires rose and fell in an hour lovers gasped and clung to each other with golden hair and red lips crooning dark-haired troubadours sang to their loves and faced off against jealous villains crag-faced warriors and conquerors reenacted stories written by men whose ancient bones were already dust. The glowing gods of Tragedia and Comedia strode through the electric dream-world in the flicker of magic lamps and gave color and life to dull muddy reality. This ancient art was practiced under the watchful eye of the Code of Hays tempering the excess and wildness of the celebrity-thespians and ensuring moral cleanliness and right-minded behavior.

However even as the lives of untold millions are unsteadied in the current age nobles and commoners alike still depend on the flow of sea however fickle trickling in from across the Pacific to improve their meager lives.

The only followers of the ancient creed that remain are the few the proud. Their foes curse them and call them devil dogs but these grim hero-cultists know themselves only as the All-Faithful. Around their barrack fires and hearths they tell the tales of Old America where steel-clad citizen-soldiers cast down their foes from half the world away where winged armor split the heavens in two with thunder and rained down burning lances upon the heads of the enemy. Whatever is left must be protected. It is left to the Fidelii to enforce the Laws of the Old Founders until a new President and Chief-of-Armys may be selected whenever that may be.

The Rangers of Muir, known to outsiders as the Woodrunners, revel in that freedom and recite the ancient creed of Conservation that the Wood-Father Muir passed down to them. Nature must be respected and preserved. In their scattered camps and remote strongholds, they watched over the forests, plains, and mountains for the siren calls of the Dark Cicada, a being that brought the cataclysmic fires that consumed the old world. The world ended to it?s fiery grasp before, and the Woodrunners are determined not to allow it to happen once more. As the mantra of their bear-god Smokey claims, ?Only you can prevent wildfires.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
