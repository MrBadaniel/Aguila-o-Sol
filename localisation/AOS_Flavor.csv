montanist_DESC;Long after the Sundering, the Mountain Fathers descended from the Rocky Mountains and preached their wisdom to the masses. Their origins were obscure, but their message was clear: the heavens were divine and the closer one was to them, the more holy. They preached of a loving God whose form encompasses the entire Earth, most importantly the sky. Since the Mountain Fathers? descent, non-monks have adopted the faith as their own though it retains a strong monastic tradition in its homeland. This homeland is protected zealously, as the Depths would like nothing more than to sever their connection to heaven. Montanists revere Jesus as the son of God and see his ascent into heaven as vindication of their message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

olympian_DESC;In the golden age of old America gods walked the land champions of mortal prowess who competed against each other in the great tournament of the Olympics for the favor of Nike goddess of victory and Therun the all-seeing all-conquering paragon of mankind. When the Event which the Olympians call Ragnarok struck down the old world many of the hero-gods of old sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Those gods that remain preside over a world full of trials and monsters one that those humans who still survive will test themselves against. All have the potential to perfect themselves in the manner of the champions of old the ascend to the status of hero-god and restore the golden age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kinemite_DESC;The Americans once crowded around great mirrors and scrying stones with religious compulsion and in the searing light of ancient magic they witnessed an endless series of rapturous wonders. Empires rose and fell in an hour lovers gasped and clung to each other with golden hair and red lips crooning dark-haired troubadours sang to their loves and faced off against jealous villains crag-faced warriors and conquerors reenacted stories written by men whose ancient bones were already dust. The glowing gods of Tragedia and Comedia strode through the electric dream-world in the flicker of magic lamps and gave color and life to dull muddy reality. This ancient art was practiced under the watchful eye of the Code of Hays tempering the excess and wildness of the celebrity-thespians and ensuring moral cleanliness and right-minded behavior.

fidelii_DESC;All has been lost. A thousand cities were put to the sword during the fall the Fifty Tribes of Old America were broken and devoured by dark treachery and unholy brimstone. The only followers of the ancient creed that remain are the few the proud. Their foes curse them and call them devil dogs but these grim hero-cultists know themselves only as the All-Faithful. Around their barrack fires and hearths they tell the tales of Old America where steel-clad citizen-soldiers cast down their foes from half the world away where winged armor split the heavens in two with thunder and rained down burning lances upon the heads of the enemy. Whatever is left must be protected. It is left to the Fidelii to enforce the Laws of the Old Founders until a new President and Chief-of-Armys may be selected whenever that may be.

forester_DESC;The vast wilderness of the west seems a land without law, without structure, without civilization. The Rangers of Muir, known to outsiders as the Foresters, revel in that freedom and recite the ancient creed of Conservation that John of the Mountains passed down to them. Nature must be respected and preserved. In their scattered camps and remote strongholds, they watched over the forests, plains, and mountains for the siren calls of the Dark Cicada, a being that brought the cataclysmic fires that consumed the old world. The world ended to it?s fiery grasp before, and the Foresters are determined not to allow it to happen once more. As the mantra of their bear-god Smokey claims, ?Only you can prevent wildfires.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
