Gregorian_DESC;The Remembrant faith Places special importance in the reverence of the dead and martyrdom through holy war, regarding the wardead as holy saints who gather in the halls of Heaven forming the Heavenly Host. Remembrants hold a cyclical worldview, where a great cataclysm puts the world on the verge of destruction in which mankind is spared of total annihilation by the intervention of the Unknown Solider, until the Second Coming. The Remembrants believe The Lord's Host will come to deliver their faithful at the end of the War to End All Wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
