Gregorian_DESC;Founded at the height of the War to End All Wars, the Remembrant Church called for all Christiandom to unify as they did during wars past against threats both inward and outward. To this end Thayendanegea Baptiste formed the Holy Legion and became the First Grand Patron to defend Christiandom. The Remembrant Church is a unification of various christian denominations, which over time have developed a consistent theology,  Remembrants cherish the sacrifices of the Unknown Saints, The Unknown Saints are the holy men who fought and died in the preservation of Christiandom. Over the centuries, Remembrants have drifted away from the Christian fold, with their reverence for war, martyrdom, and nationhood alienating many other Christians. Protestants accuse the the Unknown Saints of being  pagan war demons while Catholics such as Ursulines and the Popes in St. Louis regard them as ignorant heretics, obsessed with foolhardy crusades and the blood of dead nations. The Remembrants consider those who die in war especially against heathens as Saints. The Grand Patron serves as an arbitrator for the Patriarchs and Bishops as well as the defender of the faith...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
