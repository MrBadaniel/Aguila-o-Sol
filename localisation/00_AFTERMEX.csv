BM_SOUTH_OF_THE_BORDER_DESC;The once-glorious Mexican Empire has been shattered: Left open to rebellion in the North due to constant incursions by the Californians, the imperial army was shattered  by Luis "la Cucaracha" at the watershed Battle of Ojinaga. That loss allowed the Plan of Ixcateopan - a coalition of freedom-minded indigenous leaders in the South to enact their wish for dissolution of the Empire and self-rule. Meanwhile, the Cristero lords of the Bajío now whisper of a new Cristiada, to reclaim their home in the name of Cristo Rey. In the Southeast, the nascent Kingdom of Yucatán seems poised to usurp Mexico's position as the dominant power, but turmoil within and the Caribbean Empire without, stand in its way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1325022;Once allies in the Plan de Ixcateopan that shattered the Mexican Empire, the Zapotecas and Mixtecas quickly found themselves at odds with each other over territorial disputes. After a brief conflict between the two peoples, the Zapoteca princess Pinopiaa and her sister, Nadxieelii, were offered offered up by their father as hostages to the Mixtecas as a pledge of peace. However, with the death of the Zapoteca king and no male heir, Pinopiaa now must return to Oaxaca to be queen of her people. But will her love and marriage to a Mixteca prince allow her to free her sister from captivity, or will it doom her bloodline and her people to subjugation by the Mixtecas?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_6900061;In 2666, after countless humiliations and constant defeats at the hands of former loyal vassals and mercenaries, La República, is in a dire situation. But if the great Mexican Empire could survive the Event unscathed, why would it not survive these trying times? That is the mandate by which Benemérito Wenceslao III Paleo y Lagos was elected in 2660, will he revitalise La República and save it from destruction or will he fail and accompany this most ancient of empires to its grave?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1810200;When he was a young man, King Luis was a member of the Dorados, the legendary company of vaqueros and cowboys that served as the empire's most effective - and unruly - task force. While in the service, he found salvation in mantling the great spirit of el Centauro and convinced many of his compatriots and fellow disciples to embark on a holy conquest of the Mexican North. At the battle of Ojinaga, Luis destroyed the Imperial Army and carved out a realm for himself, claiming the legacy of the North. However, King Louis is no longer a young man - he is now 80 years old, and it seems that his spirit will soon join the great spirits of old in their jubilee. Although his son Jesús seems like a worthy successor, some still fear that without Luis to guide it, this new kingdom is doomed to fall as quickly as it emerged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1910000;King Gastón of las Bajas is one of the few truly great rulers left in California. Although his personal habits leave something to be desired, nobody can deny that Gastón is one of the strongest and most skilled warriors in all of California. As the Empire of California continues its slow decline, Gastón finds himself in a unique position. Will Gaston be content with his current title, or will he shed his hedonism and use his unique gifts to aim for something... greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fidencista;Fidencista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
fidencista_DESC;In the cult of "el Niño Fidencio" follow a pantheon of quasi-deities derived from Catholic saints and heroes of the past, who are ultimately subservient to God but powerful in their own right. These entities are called upon for guidance and can be communed with through ritualistic means, but the most faithful heirs to "el Niñito" can allow themselves to become possessed by the saints to perform miracles and act as a conduit to allow the divine to directly influence the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sacred_heart;Sagrado Corazón;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
sacred_heart_DESC;The "Missionaries of the Sacred Heart" combine traditions of the old Catholic church with an eagerness to incorporate local traditions and saints into the faith - even going as far as to elevate the angel of death to a quasi-deity. Championed by many great Beneméritos, the religion quickly took root in the religious chaos of Mexico as the dominant religion of the region. it has caused friction with the other Catholic splinter churches who regard the faithful as polytheistic heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sacred_heart_FEATURES;§Y*§!Homosexual followers of the Sagrado Corazón are allowed to marry other homosexual characters. \n§Y*§!

cristo_rey;Cristo Rey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
cristo_rey_DESC;The Cruzados de Cristo Rey - Christ the King - was organized to hold the splintering Church in Mexico together and to defent it against its enemies. Made into a personal prelature, over time the Cristeros filled the void of a strong church leadership and assumed de-facto control of many of the ordinal functions of the Church in Mexico. In the absence of what they see as a legitimate pope, the Cristeros have elevated their Prelado - or Prelate - to the position of "Steward of the Church" who assumes many of the administrative duties of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cristo_rey_FEATURES;§Y*§!May declare Crusades known as Cristiadas within the borders of Old Mexico\n§Y*§! May experience visions of the Blessed Virgin called Marian Apparitions.\n§Y*§! May expend Piety to raise units of zealots during a war\n§Y*§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
reformista;Reformista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
reformista_DESC;In the religious turmoil of the Mexican Empire, some Beneméritos have wished to exercise a more direct control over the church. These so called "Reformistas" wish to push reforms to reduce the power of the church and subordinate it to the crown, claiming "The fate of men's souls is far too important to be decided by effeminate priests and bishops. The affairs of the crown are above the affairs of the so-called 'spirit.'";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
  
purificador;Purificador;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
purificador_DESC;Purificadores - Purifiers - are a loosely organized christian doctrine that has its roots in pentecostal missions established not long before the Event. They believe that the faith's arrival to Central America was the first seal of the Apocalypse being broken. Such is their eschatology, that they identify even their fellow Christians as the prophesied "Whore of Babylon". Their fundamentalist views cause them to reject all other faiths as idolatrous and satanic and they are willing to make them see their error, by force if need be - "For those who are taken into the family of God, shall be gifted.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
  
penitente;Penitente;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
penitente_DESC;Penitentes - Penitents - are so called because they believe that after the Event, the world was given a second chance at redemption - which must be atoned for with sorrowful and extenuant rituals that were once reserved for the holiest of weeks - as now every week must be holy. The Penance that must be performed can be as little as praying face to the floor, to being honored pallbearers of enormous images from the Passion of Christ, to self-mortification. These traditions make them a disciplined people, capable of doing anything for their brothers in sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
 
moravian;Unitas Fratrum;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
moravian_DESC;Unitas Fratrum, or "Unity of the Brethren"," is a Christian church whose message of reformation and unity quickly took root in Central America in the wake of the Event. The Unitas Fratrum, who owes its origin in Central America to ancient missions in La Moskitia, cherishes its unity as a valuable treasure entrusted to it by the Lord as it represents the oneness of all humankind in the Body of Christ. Therefore the ecumenical movement is of its very lifeblood - permitting the incorporation of many traditions and structures  with its middle-ground theology under the guidance of the Church. For a millennia, it has pointed towards the unity of the scattered children of God that they may become one in their Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
navegante;Navegante;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
navegante_DESC;Navigantes believe those who are brave and those who are patient are blessed by the sea. While legends warn of the dangers and curses beneath the rolling waves, our Saviour and Provider calls us to walk over these waters with his grace so he may gift us our daily Manna of the Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mictlantec;Mictlantec;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
mictlantec_DESC;The Mictlantecos maintains that the keeper of "Mictlán" - the underworld - took mercy on Humanity after their complete destruction in the previous cycle and guided them back to the land of the living. According to the Mictlantecos, the destructive end of the last cycle was brought about by the neglect and abandonment of sacrifice to spiritual entities known as "dueños" - the true "owners" of the land - who dwell in the hills, springs, caves, and other natural features that dot the landscape. The Mictlantecos believe that death is a necessary aspect of the equilibrium of life and that a regular practice of the ancient sacrifices and celebratory rituals is necessary to maintain the balance of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
mictlantec_FEATURES;§Y*§! May go on vision quests with the aid of sacramental herbs.\n§Y*§! Must regularly perform grand sacrifices of animals or risk a loss of piety and prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
  
sol_invicta;Sol Invicto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
sol_invicta_DESC;Sol Invictistas believe that at the end of the second era, the Serpent covered the world in darkness and chaos. To combat this evil, the Sun clothed his wife, the Moon, in his fiery raiment as she gave birth to a son who would be sent to vanquish the evil. Like the instruction and final great sacrifice of the second Messiah, the Messiah of the third era, the Son of the Sun, devoted his life to creating the Seven Seals and rituals that trap the Serpent in the underworld and keep the darkness at bay. As successor of this final Messiah, the Gran Hijo del Sol and his Guardians must keep ever viligant and maintain the seals through proper worship of God the Sun, the Sol Invicto, lest the Serpent return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
sol_invicta_FEATURES;§Y*§! The Gran Hijo del Sol is elected using the same mechanics as the Pope. \n§Y*§! Adherents can devote themselves to of one of three specific messiah-patrons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
  
lamanita;Lamanita;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lamanita_DESC;The Latter Day Saints arrived in Central America not long before the Event, as Elder missionaries came to spread the message of Prophet Joseph Smith to the descendants of the Lamanites. The Lamanitas - so named in honor of their forebears - believe the events described in the Book of Mormon ocurred in Central America and have special veneratation for ancestors and exalted figures who were mistaken as gods in the past. An ancient prophecy holds that the Lamanitas 'shall blossom as a rose,' and they are keen to see its fulfillment in these very times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
furiegi;Furiegi;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
furiegi_DESC;Furiegi - the Prayers - are the ancestral beliefs of the Garifuna syncretized with Mormon theology developed from missionary work. They differ from the Lamanite Church in structure and practice, with a priority on traditional matriarchal authority, and a purely ritual use of alcohol..;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###########Government###########  
  
mex_imperial_government;Antiguo Régimen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
mex_imperial_government_desc;The leaders of the Mexican Empire have long claimed that their system of governance is a direct continuation of the administration of Old Mexico. While their claim is unverifiable, it is unquestionable that their system retains many of the qualities of centralized government that Old Mexico possessed. In this system, all land and water within imperial territory is originally owned by the crown, who has the right to transfer this ownership to particular. Hence, private property is a privilege created by the Emperor. This permits the Emperor to grant and revoke titles at will.;;;;;;x  
mex_elective;Dedocracia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
succ_mex_elective;Dedocracia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
succ_mex_elective_desc;The Mexican Empire follows an ancient tradition of succession in which the Benemérito must secretly select his heir - known as the "Tapado" and then reveal him in a ceremony known as "el Destape." During the ceremony, the Benemérito points to his chosen successor and the most powerful individuals of the realm must decide whether to accept the charge or to defy his wishes and nominate their own candidate. Only commanders of the Empire, the Benemérito's council and immediate family are able to be selected as the "Tapado" and care should be taken in the selection - as the secrecy of the process is vital to the stability of the Empire. Should one discover who is to be the next Benemérito, the cunning minds of the court of Mexico may be able to undermine the Empire with their ambitions.;;;;;;x
