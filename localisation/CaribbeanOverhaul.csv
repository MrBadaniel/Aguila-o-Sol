insular_DESC;Steadfastly refusing to recognize the religious authorities in Mexico, St. Louis, or Quebec as legitimate leaders of Catholicism, the Catholic Bishops in the Caribbean began administering their respective dioceses or "Insula" with their own unique rites. While the teachings of Caribbean Catholic priests generally stay within mainstream Catholicism, foreign Christians often opine that many of the "African Saints" venerated by individual Insular Catholics are suspiciously similar to the entities venerated in Voodoo and Santeria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wormwoodist_DESC;Wormwoodism began as a movement within Insular Catholicism, named after Bishop Wormwood of Andros. Bishop Wormwood strongly condemned the practices of the African-rooted syncretic religions of the Caribbean, condemning especially those who engaged in those practices while professing Catholicism. He also accused the Popes in St. Louis of forging a false apostolic succession from whole cloth, characterizing them as wolves in sheep's clothing. After the conquest of the Caribbean by Portia Bustamante, Wormwoodists turned on the Insular clergy, claiming that their inaction with regards to the growing influence of the Afro-syncretists and the St. Louis Papacy means that the Insular Clergy must be violently overthrown and replaced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
