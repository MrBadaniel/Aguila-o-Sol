woodrunner.2.title;Controlled Fires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.2.desc;Walking in the local woods has become exceedingly difficult, thanks to an uncontrolled growth of vegetation on the ground. It has gotten out of hand to the point where some rangers are refusing to patrol until the growth is managed. After several days of debate, one of my advisors has come out with an unorthodox solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.3.desc; I am out on patrol one day when I come across a large, totally untouched berry bush. I recognize the species as both edible and soon to go out of season. As I finish harvesting the bush, I realize that I will never be able to eat all the berries myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.4.title;The Woodland Artist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.4.desc;Other humans are rare sites deep in the woods, but today I have spotted one, on the edge of a local lake. He introduces himself as Adam Sansel, and describes himself as an artist, asking if I would be interested in purchasing any paintings. His work is striking- it looks almost indistinguishable from the subject it is meant to portray. The glory of nature seems to be his favorite subject, and he offers to sell me a painting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.5.title;The Electric Boy Scout;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.5.desc;A scoutmaster has come to me with a somewhat strange issue. One of his scouts has constructed an interesting device through forage and common household items. The device involves a chunk of lodestone, a small hand crank, and a disc made of pure copper. When the crank is used, sparks are generated, and the device can cause a shock, similar but much weaker than that generated by lightning. While the invention doesn’t seem to have any practical use, it’s certainly interesting, and harnessing the power of lightning is certainly worthy of some recognition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.1.title;The Wild Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woodrunner.1.desc;While patrolling a rural area of woodland, I come across a small log cabin, guarded by a friendly but tough-looking dog. After some investigation, I meet the shack’s inhabitant in the backyard. He explains that he was once an inhabitant of a nearby settlement, but chose to live a rural life in the woods. While this particular section of forest is designated as not for human settlement, he seems to be treating the land well- I can count as many saplings as I can stumps. “So,” he eventually asks, “What are you here for?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
