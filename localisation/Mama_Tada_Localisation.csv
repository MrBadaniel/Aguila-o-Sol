God had decided to punish the natives for their sinful ways, but through Mary they were given a second chance, and chose Besikö Kruningrobu and her daughter as prophets for the Salvation of all the indigenous people of the Americas. They commanded their faithful to live without excesses and promised deliverance from the White Demons. They worship God through a ritual chant and dance called “Cantele”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
