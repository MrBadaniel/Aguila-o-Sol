montane_DESC;Long after the Sundering, the Mountain Fathers descended from the Rocky Mountains and preached their wisdom to the masses. Their origins were obscure, but their message was clear: the heavens were divine and the closer one was to them, the more holy. They preached of a loving God whose form encompasses the entire Earth, most importantly the sky. Since the Mountain Fathers? descent, non-monks have adopted the faith as their own though it retains a strong monastic tradition in its homeland. This homeland is protected zealously, as the Depths would like nothing more than to sever their connection to heaven. montanes revere Jesus as the son of God and see his ascent into heaven as vindication of their message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
