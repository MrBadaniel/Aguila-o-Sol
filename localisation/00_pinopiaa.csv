# EVTTITLE_pinopiaa_3;A Curious Correspondence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_pinopitaa_3;Esteemed Jefe Politico,\nI reach out to you with hopes of cooperation despite our past conflicts. Recent events compel me to seek a strategic partnership to safeguard my realm's autonomy within my current marriage.

# EVTTITLE_pinopiaa_4;An Ungracious Declination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_pinopiaa_4;Señorita Pinopiaa,\nYour proposition, while intriguing, borders on the absurd. It is no secret that our realms have been bitter adversaries for generations, and the notion of collaboration between us is laughable at best. Your feeble attempt to avoid being a junior partner in your marriage is duly noted, but I assure you that such concerns are of little consequence to me.\nSaludos,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_pinopiaa_5;A Tempting Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_pinopiaa_5;As Pinopiaa reads the reply from the Jefe Politico of Puebla, a sense of dread grips her. The contents of the letter reveal a disturbing proposition that threatens to compromise her ideals and betray the legacy of her ancestors. Masking his insatiable hunger for power beneath honeyed words, the Jefe Político lays bare his ambitions to expand his domain into La Mixteca of Puebla - territories that were won from the Mexicans by her grandfather and his Mixtec allies during the Plan of Ixcateopan. As she pens her response, Pinopiaa finds herself at a crossroads. Will she succumb to the temptation of the Jefe Politico's corrupt bargain, forsaking the ideals for which her ancestors fought and died? Or will she stand firm in her convictions, rejecting the offer and preserving the freedom of the South at all costs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_pinopiaa_5;Perhaps... it's a sacrifice worth making.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
