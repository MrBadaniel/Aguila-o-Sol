EVTDESC_raymond10;My search has finally some results! A fellow Dorado has offered me his sword and has brought with him over five hundred men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondcourtierarrived;The Scarab will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESC_raymond12;The alleged witness came to me today, ushering me to meet him outside my court at night, for our halls are "riddled with the eyes of our liege." Yet I can't help but be reluctant to expose myself in such a manner. In my halls, I am defended, but outside of them, I am like any other man. What if he is a fake?\n Oh, whatever am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondtrust; They seem trustworthy enough. I will go and meet them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondcondemn;They are just another pawn of the Carmines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_raymondtrustedwitness;The Scarab Exposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond13;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. "To meet alone is the only way to have secrecy," I grumble under my breath. But as I take steps forward through the castle's courtyard, I can't help but feel uneasy. The grip around my scimitar's handle tightens. As I walk through assorted sets of walls, it is not long before I am in the wilderness. "Im glad you came," a voice behind me calls out. In a minute, I turn with my scimitar unsheathed, yet I am only met with the sight of the Angeleno witness before me. "Lord Abbas, rightful ruler of Socal, I am not your enemy." He says calmly. "We share a common foe, and I have much to disclose to you about them." He hands me a scroll, sealed with the Scarab of House Carmine. Inscribed are the orders for the murder of my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondtrustwitness; This is all the proof I need! I will have their heads for this!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_raymondcondemnedwitness;A Murder in the Woods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond14;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. Is there a better way to catch a noble than to catch him alone in the woods, without any guards? I retire to my chambers for the night, and doze off to sleep quickly.\n The words of one of my castle servants shakes me from my rest. "My lord, there is a dead peasant outside your castle. I am not quite sure what fate befell him." I immediately shot up and ran to the walls. Surely enough, the witness I hired was lying dead on the gravel, covered in lacerations. "We are not sure of his cause of death, my lord." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondcondemnedwitness; He was a true witness indeed. And now he is lying dead on the dirt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_raymondtrustedspy;The Scarab Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond16;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. "To meet alone is the only way to have secrecy," I grumble under my breath. But as I take steps forward through the castle's courtyard, I can't help but feel uneasy. The grip around my scimitar's handle tightens. As I walk through assorted sets of walls, it is not long before I am in the wilderness. "Im glad you came," a voice behind me calls out. In a minute, I turn with my scimitar unsheathed, but before I can swing it for the foe before me a dagger is firm in my chest. My scimitar clangs to the ground as I collapse to my knees. The "witness" from earlier walks towards me, a disdainful look in his eyes as he grabs my sword and glances down at me. "The Carmines send their regards.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondtrustspy; N-no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_raymondcondemnedspy;A Foiled Murder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond17;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. Is there a better way to catch a noble than to catch him alone in the woods, without any guards? I retire to my chambers for the night, and doze off to sleep quickly.\n The words of one of my castle guards shakes me from my rest. "My lord, a man attempted upon your life while you slept. Rest assured, we caught him before he even set a foot in the keep." I quickly shot out of bed and walked out to the main hall of my castle. "His body is not here anymore, a castle is no fitting place for a rotting murderer. You may want to see this note, milord." The guard handed me a blood splattered note, sealed with the Scarab of House Carmine. The note detailed my own murder!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondcondemnedspy; Damned be the Carmines!! This is as proof as any!!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond18;The proof has been laid before me — there is no questioning it now. The hands of the Carmines are stained with my family's blood. Rage courses through me at the realization of this treachery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondwar; Rally the banners! We ride for Balboa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondquiet; This is not the time for war, but my time will come soon. I must plot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymond21;For many centuries, my family were loyal subjects of the emperor. It was the decline of the Yudkow dynasty that brought upon their demise. Many Cetics in my court argue whether or not the Yudkows have lost the heavenly right to rule California — is this so? I have a choice to support the liege of my ancestors, or go on my own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondsocalkowtow;The Abbas dynasty will always be loyal to the emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondsocalindependent;The empire is dead — I will make my own fate for Socal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond20;[From.GetFirstNameWithDynasty], I hereby decree that you have no right to the title King, your unjust actions prove it thus. Vengeance has finally been gained against the Carmines, and now [From.GetFirstNameWithDynasty] stands before you to hear your judgment..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondexecute;The Carmines must answer for the deaths of my fathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondmerciful;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymond22;As I grow tired from assorted lowborn complaints on a busy day in court, I am shocked awake by the banners of Baja triumphantly flying into my room. The emissary stands before me, reading from an ornate scroll. "I do believe it is time for you to pay your dowry. Accept the Kingdom of Baja California as Suzerain, or we will meet on the field of combat.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondbajawar;I never agreed to such a deal!! To arms!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondbajapeace;My realm is too weak to afford another war. I have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTTITLE_raymondcarmineabdication;The Carmine Abdication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond38;You weren't expecting the entourage of his majesty, the King of Socal to appear in your court, but the bright red Scarabs of the house storm your hall, the King in his regalia approaching. "raymond of Socal," he calls out, with a sorrowful look in his eyes. "I have heard of your investigations into my family history, and it is with sorrow I can say that it is true. Due to the sins of my fathers against the righteousness of this world, I have no choice but to abdicate my throne to you. I hope you are a more merciful and just liege than my father was to yours, raymond of Socal." Kneeling before you, the king removes the gemmed crown from his head and offers it to you. It can be said, once more, that House Abbas has come to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondmyreign;My reign begins now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond37;My mind is thrown into a panic as my throneroom is turned into a sea of red, as dozens of Carmine banners fly into my room. At the head of a magnificent entourage is none other than the King of Socal. "My family has wronged you, and I offer my apologies. But I cannot afford to step down. I must right their wrongs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymond37a;I understand. Rule well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymond37b;This doesn't begin to pay for my fathers death!! To arms!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond24;I have received a summons from the Imperial Court. His majesty, the emperor of the Celestial Empire of California, has summoned me on urgent duty, regarding my recent seizure of the Kingdom of Socal. If his demands are too unreasonable, Socal is not obliged to listen to his call — but due to the ties our family share, I feel obligated to at least hear the man out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondsacramento;To Sacramento I must go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond25;I have arrived in the great city of Sacramento, and at the gates of the Celestial Palace. The emperor is waiting inside. A knot grows in my chest as I approach the great Redwood doors of the palace, and push them open. Sitting before me is none other than the Celestial Emperor himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondemperor;And now, I must hear his words...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_raymondBEARPALACE;The Imperial Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond26;"raymond of Socal, you have been brought before the Earthly Reflection of Heaven's Throne, to answer for the repercussions of your deeds. In the words of the Lawgiver, 'Our actions are are the structures of time, and all history grows wild around them.'\nIt is true that I, the Son of Heaven, sent the courtier who revealed the truth behind the Carmines and their treachery. I and my Temporal Council have spent a great deal of time to rectify the actions of my predecessors, who, in struggle against the Pleasure Dome, have threatened the Prime Mandate. As your forefather and mine once did, you stand on the precipice of an instance. Hear the words of your sovereign, — or damn us all. Of this I can no more convince you if you do not wish.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymond27;The Emperor slumps in his throne. His head hangs in his hands. "If this is your choice, I cannot persuade you otherwise. Know this: you are ensnared in the machinations of this world, and the evils that drive it. Call it Moloch or Shaitan, they will pour out bloodshed as the draught of your thirsts. May it be that the day comes, when you stand before your namesake in the world beyond, and answer to him why you denied his witness and Injunctions." \n The Emperor looks out the window, all pride and stature gone out of his face. The brilliant red and white of his robes seem faded, and the Bear crown looks less fearsome in the fading light. "Leave me. The night is falling, and the Dianet must rest with California for a time."\n Unthinking of it, you turn without a bow and leave. The Totally Righteous figurehead does not even comment on it, lost in the wheels of his mind. At the threshold of the throneroom, you seal the redwood doors of the Empire behind you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondonwards;Onwards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond28;"What set apart Elton and raymond was their ability to do what those who came before and after them could not: to break the cycles of violence and ambition. When raymond won at San Francisco, it was only by loss that he could rise above the intoxications of power and look around him. He saw the nation he had built threatened by his actions, a brother he loved slain by pursuit of conquest. Pain forged him. In Three Days he gained the wisdom it would take the others three lifetimes to gain — he stepped aside and so, won. He found victory by the victorious struggle of a different sort: to set aside violence and subjugation, to take rule and law.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond29;"Others faced that moment too, but they could not turn aside. They ran forward like a man on fire, terrifying and brilliant, yet what drove them consumed them. Heartache and downfall were their legacies. Socal was Zakarriya's — and it lasted, more safe and secure than any other realm in all the Bear Land. The Supreme Heart of the Valley called himself the Anointed One, and he died with an arrow in his gut. Who still follows the Hubs, the Silics, or the Thoughtless Path? None. Who yet still follows the ways of the Imamites? A multitude.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond30;"Elton faced the same test. He earned his agonies early, and they purified him. Others would have taken Sacramento by arms, slain the Strutters, but not Elton. It was only because he had been with Blackedgers, and loved them like family that he knew what it was like to be at the other point of the knife, and drink the bottomless cup of retribution. When he put his life in Hardin Strutter's hands, he knew the words of your prophet, Jesus of Nazareth: What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul — for what can a man sell his soul? Elton changed all of California when he was able to put a future for his people above his own ambitions. He had a victory of a higher, greater sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond31;Now, here we stand. We are the children of our forefathers, and we must hope we have their wisdom. I have seen my dynasty's legacy wither to nothing, and you seethe with vengeance against those who butchered your father. You may ask yourself, "What has this man done for me? What did he do for my father?" And the truth is: little enough. I do not ask you to come here for me. I do not ask you to come here for yourself either.\n I have summoned you here for the good of California.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond32;"The other choice is one much more difficult. To surrender. To begin the long effort to reunite California, to stand beneath the bear Flag once again. It was this Empire that brought peace, and this Empire's fall that has engendered the ways of strife once again. And the Empire needs a strong hand such as yours to reverse this decline. The restitution of those things that have fallen into disrepair is a mode you have become well acquainted with in the last few years. It is only one who has been forged by suffering that can see beyond it, into the final frontier of the future. I ask you, raymond, to take up this partnership as Musa did, though ever more tightly. I ask you to be my strong right hand as Hardin was to Elton. Only by admitting the need for each other can we achieve what is greater than ourselves.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymond33;In your mind's eye, you feel the weight of your soul and those who came before you fly around your thoughts. You think of the Carmines and your butchered father, of figurehead Emperors and court intrigue. You think of the Prophet and the Lawgiver, of raymond, Musa, and Annil. There are the dreams of independence for Socals and nightmares of a California in endless strife. You think of the precipice of the moment, of the choice between one's self and one's others. You think of Sacramento. Los Angeles. San Francisco. Pride, wisdom, love. Honor. Duty. At last, you can find only one course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond34;The Emperor does not even flinch when you draw your sword — though he does raise himself up when you kneel. Before the great throne of California, you bow. "I shall not pledge my loyalty to the Emperor again, your Grace, for it has never been truly lost. By the will of God, I shall lend my sword to you, and to the restitution of that which has long been neglected. As you serve California, so shall I serve you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond35;[e_california.Holder.GetFirstName] says nothing at first, but he takes the Black and White ring from his finger, carved with the ancient Chinese symbols of Balance and Tau, and he puts it upon your own. In the evening torchlight he seems half man and half image, red and white robe blazing with color, Bear Crown practically come alive with the glinting gold. When he speaks, it is like an echo of centuries that come down, tying together the promises of your ancestors in new bonds.\n "With warriors such as you, the Greatest has granted us victory. I shall be like a fish who has discovered water when I am within your brave presence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond36;With the title of Anti-Governatus, and imperial favor. I have a new purpose in my heart, and with it, I will go forward and help the Emperor in building the California my ancestors have aspired to forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondgovernator;Let us move forth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondvassal;I am ever your loyal vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_raymondlistentoemperor;I will heed your words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondokboomer;Your empire is dying, and with it, your false aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymond40;It has been some time since you rejected the emperor's offer of vassalship, and in it, you have done a lot of studying. Was Imam Musa ever justified in bowing? Perhaps the faithful of Islam should not tether themselves to Cetic ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondalawiyya;May [e_california.Holder.GetFirstName]'s frauds die with his empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondimamite;This is not the path my ancestors would smile on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymond45;You have continued your study of Islamic philosophy, and have uncovered a new path. The way of the Pure and True combines ancient philosophy with Islamic practices. You would be able to maintain your current Bureaucratic management while embracing new ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondqingzhen;I will follow the Pure Way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_raymondimamite2;I am an Imamite, through and through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPT_raymondimamite2;Your studies of Californian Islam ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymondcouriersend;You have heard rumblings that a landed member of House Philippus is recruiting men. Long ago your ancestors and his ancestors fought together. It might be a good idea to send some support...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_raymondcouriersend;Perhaps when the time comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_raymondcouriersend;I don't have the time or the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_raymondabdicate;You have received news that the governor of Socal has abdicated his position to his vassal raymond Abbas upon learning of his family's role in Yassir Abbas's death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_raymondabdicate;It is the honorable thing to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_raymondwarnotif;Civil War in Socal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymondwarnotif;You have received reports that raymond Abbas has declared war on his Carmine liege, alleging that his family was responsible for the death of his relative Yassir and that he is the rightful ruler of Socal. You are unable to intervene directly, which is just as well — you are unsure whether Abbas will be more loyal to the Empire in the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_raymondwarnotif;Let's see how this plays out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_raymondintegrate;Integration of Socal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_raymondintegrate;You have received amazing news from Socal! raymond Abbas, fresh from his victory in the civil war, has visited your court. He has sworn full fealty to the Celestial Throne, giving the Empire true ownership over the rich lands and plentiful troops of Socal for the first time in decades. This is an auspicious occasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_raymondintegrate;Hopefully Socal is only the first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
